# Johansen Engineering Steiner VCF

# Purpose
Test some of the original designs for inspiration and reference.

# Status - Preliminary tests
## Errata
### Errata - THT VCF
* C111 reverse polarity
* R102 should go from +10v to connection between R103 and R106 - and +10v sould not go to Q102 base - Critical
 
## Issues and Notes
 * The filter needs adjustments and the feedback is not stable. a 56k from CV to base of Q102 helps a bit.
